# e4steam compatibility

Client startup and Steam multiplayer are tracked separately. A successful
main-menu launch proves loader compatibility; it does not by itself prove a
two-player Steam session.

Legend: ✅ verified · ⏳ not yet manually verified · — unsupported.

## Windows client launch matrix

On 2026-08-01, 99 clean Windows x64 test instances reached Minecraft's main
menu with e4steam 0.2.0 installed. Fabric and Quilt instances included the
matching Fabric API.

| Loader | Minecraft versions launched | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fabric | 1.17–1.21.11, 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | 33/33 ✅ |
| Quilt | 1.17–1.21.11, 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | 33/33 ✅ |
| Forge | 1.17.1–1.20.2 | 12/12 ✅ |
| NeoForge | 1.20.2–1.21.11, 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | 21/21 ✅ |

The machine-readable local results are generated in
`build/client-compatibility.json`. Minecraft 26.x uses the modern
Fabric/Quilt artifact.

## Windows host/guest multiplayer matrix

The maintainer manually reconfirmed the supported multiplayer flow on
2026-08-02: open a single-player world, create the Steam connection, invite a
second Steam account, join as a guest, exchange Minecraft TCP traffic, and use
UDP voice-mod traffic. These checks are manual and are not currently executed
by GitHub Actions.

| Artifact boundary | Loader | Host/guest | Steam invitation | TCP | UDP voice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.17 | Fabric / Quilt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.17.1 | Forge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.18.2 | Fabric / Quilt / Forge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.20.2 | Fabric / Quilt / Forge / NeoForge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.21.11 | Fabric / Quilt / NeoForge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 26.2 | Fabric / Quilt / NeoForge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

This table records the principal artifact boundaries, not every intermediate
loader build. The full 99-entry client matrix remains the broader loader-start
coverage.

## Platform status

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | ✅ Primary platform; client launch and manual multiplayer verified |
| Linux x64 | Experimental; CI compiles and tests, multiplayer not manually verified |
| macOS | — Unsupported |
| 32-bit operating systems | — Unsupported |

Dedicated servers are unsupported.

The same loader/version JAR is used on Windows x64 and Linux x64. All six
release artifacts bundle native libraries for both operating systems; Linux
remains experimental because its multiplayer path has not been manually
verified yet.

## Modpack compatibility

Normal Minecraft mod traffic uses the tunneled TCP connection automatically.
The Steam bridge also carries UDP for Simple Voice Chat, Plasmo Voice, or the
single fallback UDP port selected in `e4steam.toml`. Mods that require several
independent UDP listening ports still need explicit support and should be
reported with the mod name and crash/latest log.

Menu buttons, the Friends screen, LAN access controls, and restored integrated
server commands are optional integrations. If another mod replaces one of
those vanilla hooks, e4steam skips the affected integration and logs one
warning instead of aborting Minecraft. The host listener and Steam address
resolver remain required because silently skipping either would advertise a
connection that cannot work.
